```powershell
$env:DB_URL="your_db_url"
$env:DB_USERNAME="your_username"
$env:DB_PASSWORD="your_password"
$env:SERVER_PORT="your_server_port"
$env:JWT_SECRET="your_jwt_secret_key"
$env:JWT_EXPIRATION="your_jwt_expiration"
```

For Linux/MacOS create env.sh file with the content:
```bash
export DB_URL="your_db_url"
export DB_USERNAME="your_username"
export DB_PASSWORD="your_password"
export SERVER_PORT="your_server_port"
export JWT_SECRET="your_jwt_secret_key"
export JWT_EXPIRATION="your_jwt_expiration"
```

> Note: Replace the fields with your actual values. Never commit these values to version control.

#### Client
Update VITE_API_BASE variable that is defined in client/.env.development with the same port as the server

### Database Setup
To set up the PostgreSQL database, follow these steps:

1. Open the PostgreSQL CLI or your preferred database management tool.
2. Create the igym_db database with the following SQL command:
   ```sql

   WITH OWNER postgres
   ENCODING 'UTF8'
   LC_COLLATE = 'en_US.UTF-8'
   LC_CTYPE = 'en_US.UTF-8'
   CONNECTION LIMIT = -1;
   ```
3. Update the database credentials in the .env file as required. Remember to not commit this changes.
